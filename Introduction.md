Hello,

I am Lin Zhao, a second year graduate student in statistics. I got my bachelor in materials science and a master degree in materials engineering. Indeed, I spent almost seven years in engineering. In my master dissertation, I had a lot of data analysis work which got me into statistics area. I was a heavy user of MATLAB and then started to use SAS, R since last year. Besides, I have some background in computer science and familiar with Python and Java. I learned how to use git and github in a class called software development process. This experience actually helps me catch up in 850.

I work as a research assistant in biological system engineering. My research is centered on estimation of crop water stress using thermal imaging. After several days of field work with strong sunlight, I realize that sitting in lab and playing with equipments are actually the best thing in research process.

I experienced a lonely childhood because I am the only kid in my family and grew up with no cats or dogs. I love border collie and hope to have one in the future.
